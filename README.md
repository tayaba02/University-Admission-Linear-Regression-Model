# University-Admission-Linear-Regression-Model
In this study, I undertook a detailed data exploration analysis to discern the correlation between various factors associated with student admission applications and their corresponding university acceptances. I constructed a linear regression model to forecast university admission outcomes, taking into account parameters like GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, Statement of Purpose (SOP), Letter of Recommendation (LOR), and CGPA.
